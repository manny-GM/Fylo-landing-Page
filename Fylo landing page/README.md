## My process
I wrote down the html file and structures and then i styled the css using desktop first method. Finally i wrote the media queries to suit the adaptation with smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project really afforded me the luxury of trying out my hands with css grid and a host of other css components that i have not had to use in my previous projects.
My manipulation of grids and flexbox together improved as i got to understand flexbox better and also css grid.

### Continued development

Moving forward, i would pick projects that would be really challenging to my understanding of css, solidifying my understanding of the fundsmentals while allowing my to try my hands with and understand the biggercomcepts in css. I am also considering picking up a css framework and a slight delve into javascript.
